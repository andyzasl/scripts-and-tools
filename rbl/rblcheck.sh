# Multi DNSBL check - rblcheck.sh
#
# rblcheck.sh checks multiple IP addresses against multiple DNS Block Lists
#
# By default, it checks all non-private IP addresses on the machine it is run
# from against a default list of DNSBLs -- SpamCop, SpamHaus and SORBS
#
# If the file /etc/dnsbliplist exists, IP addresses will be read (one per line)
# from it instead.
#
# If the file /etc/dnsblacklists exists, DNSBL entries will be read (one per 
# line) from it.
#
# Comments starting with @# are allowed in the IP list and DNS block list.
# Entries in the block list are whitespace delimited. The string "IP" is
# replaced in the URL with the IP address that has been blocked when reporting
# a block.
# Format of the DNS block list file is:
#   BlocklistName   BlocklistDNSServer   URL
#
# If no IP addresses are blocked, it will run silently and return 0.
# For each IP address blocked, it will output the blocked IP address, the DNSBL
# name, and the URL for the blocklist. If any IP address has been blocked, it
# returns 1.
#
# This script can be invoked manually (e.g. `./rblcheck.sh'), but was designed
# to be run via cron (by placing it in /etc/cron.hourly/ or similar).
